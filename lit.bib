@article{Wong2003,
abstract = {In a deformable granular medium, shear deformation results in a change in pore volume, thereby causing a change in permeability. In previous studies, it is assumed that the change in absolute permeability is a function of porosity or volumetric strain, which in turn is a function of the mean or minimum effective stress. In such semi-empirical correlations, the changes in permeability are equal in all directions, even though the changes in strains are different in each direction. This paper proposes a new model accounting for permeability anisotropy induced by strains in deformable porous media. This model is derived from the well-known phenomenological Kozeny-Carman equation with some modifications. It was proven that tensor parameters embedded in the Kozeny-Carman equation (hydraulic radius and tortuosity of flow channels) can be expressed in terms of principal strains for granular assemblies of idealized packings. This approach allows one to formulate the evolution of changes in permeability in three directions under continous shearing. The model explicitly states that the permeability changes are anisotropic, dependent on the induced strains. A comparison between experimental data and predicted results is presented to show the validity of the proposed model.},

@article{Du2007,
abstract = {A fully coupled geomechanics-reservoir model is developed to simulate the directional changes in permeability due to fluid injection and production in a reservoir. The model is implemented numerically by fully coupling a geomechanics model with a single-phase reservoir flow model using the finite element method. A strain-induced permeability model is developed based on the analysis of the grain fabric of intact and sheared oil sand specimens using a thin section imaging method. It can quantify the changes in permeability when material experiences shear deformation. In addition, the directions of the principal values of permeability are not restricted to some arbitrary axes, but governed by the induced strains. Thus, the effects of stress path and stress level are implicitly considered through effective stress-strain constitutive laws. The transient pressure response of a water injection test in a horizontal well is analyzed. Parametric, studies are also conducted to investigate the effects of permeability, deformability and initial stress conditions on the injection pressure. It is found that the changes in permeability resulting from dilations of the oil sands cannot be captured using the conventional permeability model as a function of volumetric strain because the volumetric strain is small. However, the strain-induced permeability model can accurately reflect the directional increase in permeability during water injection. It is shown that the induced pore pressure is relatively insensitive to the deformation modulus of the reservoir, as compared to the permeability. The initial stress condition dominates the propensity of hydraulic fracturing.},

@article{Vik2018,
abstract = {This study investigates the effect of thermoelastic interactions between multiple parallel fractures on energy production from a multiple-fracture enhanced geothermal system. A coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element model has been developed that accounts for non-isothermal fluid flow within the fractures, conductive heat transfer in the rock matrix, and the mechanical deformation of the matrix. The model results show that the matrix deformation significantly increases the interactions between the two adjacent fractures. Matrix contraction due to the cooling of the matrix increases the fracture aperture in the adjacent fracture, and facilitates the creation of favourable flow pathways between the injection and production wells. These flow paths reduce the energy production from the system. The effects of fracture spacing, reservoir temperature gradient and mechanical properties of the rock matrix on the production temperature and the net production energy are investigated. It is shown that the spacing calculated based on the assumption of rigid matrix (constant uniform aperture) are too small, and in order to account for the thermoelastic interactions, the spacing between fractures should be further increased to maximise the net energy production from the system. Otherwise, the multiple-fracture system fails to improve the energy recovery from the geothermal reservoir, as initially intended.},

journal="Computational Geosciences",
volume="6",
number="3",
pages="269--284",
abstract="This work presents the coupling of two locally conservative methods for elliptic problems: namely, the discontinuous Galerkin method and the mixed finite element method. The couplings can be defined with or without interface Lagrange multipliers. The formulations are shown to be equivalent. Optimal error estimates are given; penalty terms may or may not be included. In addition, the analysis for non-conforming grids is also discussed.",
